STEP 7 - USING PYSPARK

1. run the Notebook
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "$(pwd)"/work:/home/jovyan/work jupyter/pyspark-notebook
Open http://localhost:8888, then fill the provided token.

2. Duplicate the "Base PySpark Note" and change content of our file with the use of pySpark commands
Reference: http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/api/python/index.html 

3. After all changes SAVE file, since after notebook will be closed all files will dissapear.
However since we duplicate all file in our work directory we will have access to saved version from our local environment
